## Getting Started
You can find BOTH .exe and .jar versions of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the src folder.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION !
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on 3. Working with Threads.exe
```
If that does not work, open .jar file:
```
Double click on 3. Working with Threads.jar
```
If both do not work, a new project must be created containing the src folder, then run.
